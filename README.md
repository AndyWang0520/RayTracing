# RayTracing


This is a simple ray tracing program implemented in C, demonstrating the basic principles of ray tracing. The program renders a scene with a floating blue sphere and a checkered base.

## Instructions

### Build and Run

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. Clone or download this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ray-tracing-c.git
cd ray-tracing-c

gcc -o ray_tracing ray_tracing.c -lm

./ray_tracing > output.ppm
```
### Result

You can view the rendered image by opening the generated PPM file (output.ppm) in an image viewer or converting it to another image format.
